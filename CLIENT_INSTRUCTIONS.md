## Step 1: Get LinkedIn Credentials

### Access Token
1. Go to https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps
2. Create a new app or select an existing one
3. Request these permissions:
   - `w_member_social` (required for posting)
   - `r_liteprofile` (required for user info)
4. Generate an **Access Token** (copy and save it)

### User URN
Your User URN format is: `urn:li:person:XXXXXXXXXX`

To find it:
- Check your LinkedIn Developer App settings
- Or use LinkedIn API: `https://api.linkedin.com/v2/me`
- It will look like: `urn:li:person:gxDS3ZTiss`

## Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop

### Find Your Config File

**macOS:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Windows:**
```
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

### Add This Configuration

Open the config file and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linkedin-post": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@biznezstack/linkedin-post-mcp",
        "--access-token",
        "YOUR_LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE",
        "--user-urn",
        "urn:li:person:YOUR_USER_ID_HERE"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example (with fake credentials):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linkedin-post": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@biznezstack/linkedin-post-mcp",
        "--access-token",
        "AQVABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefgh",
        "--user-urn",
        "urn:li:person:abc123XYZ"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing required credentials" Error
- Check your config file has both `--access-token` and `--user-urn`
- Verify no typos in the JSON syntax
- Restart Claude Desktop

### "401 Unauthorized" When Posting
- Your access token may be expired
- Generate a new token from LinkedIn Developer Portal
- Update your config file and restart Claude

### Posts Don't Appear on LinkedIn
- Verify your app has `w_member_social` permission
- Check you're using the correct User URN
- Try posting directly from LinkedIn API to test credentials

### Claude Doesn't See the Tools
- Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close window)
- Reopen Claude Desktop
- Check config file for JSON syntax errors
- Try: `npx @biznezstack/linkedin-post-mcp --access-token test --user-urn test` in terminal to verify installation
